/*
Notes-->

Browser-Side vs. Server-Side Requests
1. Browser-Side Requests: 
When your frontend code (running in the browser) tries to make an AJAX request to a different domain, 
the browser enforces CORS. If the server (the different domain) does not allow your domain to access its resources, the browser 
blocks the request and raises a CORS error.

2. Server-Side Requests: 
When your backend server (running on your domain) makes a request to another server (e.g., Googleâ€™s API), 
the browser's CORS policy does not apply. The backend server can freely communicate with any external server. 
The response from the external server is then sent back to your frontend by your backend server, and since this communication
happens within the same origin (your domain), CORS is not an issue.
